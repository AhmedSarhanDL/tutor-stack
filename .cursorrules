# Cursor Rules for Tutor Stack Project

## Python Virtual Environment
- Always activate the Python virtual environment before running Python commands
- Use `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
- For terminal commands that involve Python, ensure the venv is activated first
- When running tests, make sure to use the virtual environment's Python interpreter

## Project Structure
- This is a Python project using Python 3.11
- The project uses a virtual environment located in `venv/`
- Use `python` from the virtual environment, not system Python
- For package management, use `pip` from the virtual environment

## Development Guidelines
- Always run Python commands with the virtual environment activated
- Use `python -m pytest` for running tests
- Use `python main.py` for running the main application
- Install packages using `pip install` within the activated environment

## Command Examples
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Run main application
python main.py

# Install packages
pip install package_name
```
