## Backend Implementation

### Content Service Endpoints

#### PDF Upload Endpoints
```http
POST /content/upload-pdf
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Parameters:
- file: PDF file (required)
- description: Optional description (optional)

Response:
{
  "filename": "document.pdf",

  "size": 1024000,
  "content_type": "application/pdf"
}
```

```http
GET /content/uploaded-files

Response:
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",

      "size": 1024000,
      "content_type": "application/pdf",
      "description": "Optional description",
      "uploaded_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "status": "processed"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Curriculum Endpoints
```http

          "description": "Sub-concept description",
          "examples": ["Sub-example 1", "Sub-example 2"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```http
GET /content/curriculum/concepts

Response:
{
  "concepts": [/* array of concepts without full details */]
}
```

```http
GET /content/curriculum/concepts/{concept_name}

Response:
{
  "name": "Concept Name",
  "description": "Concept description",
  "examples": ["Example 1", "Example 2"],
  "sub_concepts": [/* sub-concepts array */]
}
```

### Data Source
The curriculum data is sourced from `services/content/unified_curriculum.json`, which contains a comprehensive collection of mathematical concepts, examples, and sub-concepts.

## Frontend Implementation

### Components

#### PdfUploadPage.tsx
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/PdfUploadPage.tsx`
- **CSS**: `frontend/src/components/PdfUploadPage.css`
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop interface
  - File validation
  - Upload progress indication
  - File list with metadata
  - Error handling and success messages

#### CurriculumViewer.tsx
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/CurriculumViewer.tsx`
- **CSS**: `frontend/src/components/CurriculumViewer.css`
- **Features**:
  - Search functionality
  - Expandable concept cards
  - Modal detail view
  - Responsive design
  - Loading and error states

### Navigation
Both features are accessible from the main Dashboard:
- **PDF Upload**: "ðŸ“„ Upload PDF" button
- **Curriculum Viewer**: "ðŸ“š View Curriculum" button

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `python-multipart==0.0.9` - For handling file uploads in FastAPI

### File Structure
```
services/content/
â”œâ”€â”€ tutor_stack_content/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py (updated with new endpoints)
â”œâ”€â”€ unified_curriculum.json (data source)
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt (updated)

frontend/src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ PdfUploadPage.tsx (new)
â”œâ”€â”€ PdfUploadPage.css (new)
â”œâ”€â”€ CurriculumViewer.tsx (new)
â””â”€â”€ CurriculumViewer.css (new)
```

### API Integration
The frontend components use the existing `api` instance from `AuthContext` to communicate with the backend endpoints.

## Usage Instructions

### PDF Upload
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Click "ðŸ“„ Upload PDF" button
3. Either drag and drop a PDF file or click "Choose File"
4. Optionally add a description
5. The file will be uploaded and appear in the list below

### Curriculum Viewer
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Click "ðŸ“š View Curriculum" button
3. Use the search bar to find specific concepts
4. Click on concept cards to expand details
5. Click "View Full Details" to see complete information in a modal

## Security Considerations

### PDF Upload
- File type validation (PDF only)
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Server-side validation
- Dummy implementation (files not actually stored)

### Curriculum Access
- Read-only access to curriculum data
- No sensitive information in curriculum JSON
- Public educational content

## Future Enhancements

### PDF Upload
- Actual file storage implementation
- PDF text extraction
- Content indexing for search
- File versioning
- User-specific file management

### Curriculum Viewer
- Bookmarking functionality
- Progress tracking
- Interactive exercises
- Related content suggestions
- Export functionality

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Test curriculum endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/curriculum

# Test uploaded files endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/uploaded-files
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the application
3. Test PDF upload with a sample PDF file
4. Test curriculum viewer search and navigation

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
- **File too large**: Check file size (max 10MB)
- **Invalid file type**: Ensure file is PDF format
- **Network errors**: Check API connectivity
- **Curriculum loading**: Verify JSON file exists and is valid

### Debug Information
- Browser console logs for frontend issues
- Backend logs for API issues
- Network tab for request/response debugging

## Performance Considerations

### PDF Upload
- Client-side file validation
- Progress indication for large files
- Efficient file handling

### Curriculum Viewer
- Lazy loading of concept details
- Efficient search implementation
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Required Features
- File API support (for drag-and-drop)
- Fetch API support
- Modern CSS features

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required for these features.

### Dependencies
Ensure `python-multipart` is installed in the content service environment.

### File Permissions
Ensure the content service has read access to `unified_curriculum.json`.
